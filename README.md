# Updated highlight-icemode with the possibility to toggle case-sensitivity
Based on [highlight-icemode](https://github.com/EsIce/highlight-icemode)

This is basically a copy of the original extension with the added possibility to toggle if highlighting should be case-sensitive or not (original was always case-insensitive):

`"highlight-icemode.caseSensitive": true`
